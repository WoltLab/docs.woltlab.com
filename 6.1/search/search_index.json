The previously used API heavily relied on larger JavaScript files that contained a lot of different components with hidden dependencies and suffered from extensive jQuery usage for historic reasons.</p> <p>Eventually a new API was designed that solves the issues with the legacy API by following a few basic principles:  1. Vanilla ES5-JavaScript.     It allows us to achieve the best performance across all platforms, there is     simply no reason to use jQuery today and the performance penalty on mobile     devices is a real issue.  2. Strict usage of modules.     Each component is placed in an own file and all dependencies are explicitly     declared and injected at the top.Eventually we settled with AMD-style modules     using require.js which offers both lazy loading and \"ahead of time\"-compilatio     with <code>r.js</code>.  3. No jQuery-based components on page init.     Nothing is more annoying than loading a page and then wait for JavaScript to     modify the page before it becomes usable, forcing the user to sit and wait.     Heavily optimized vanilla JavaScript components offered the speed we wanted.  4. Limited backwards-compatibility.     The new API should make it easy to update existing components by providing     similar interfaces, while still allowing legacy code to run side-by-side for     best compatibility and to avoid rewritting everything from the start.</p>"},{"location":"javascript/new-api_writing-a-module/#defining-a-module","title":"Defining a Module","text":"<p>The default location for modules is <code>js/</code> in the Core's app dir, but every app and plugin can register their own lookup path by providing the path using a template-listener on <code>requirePaths@headIncludeJavaScript</code>.</p> <p>For this example we'll assume the file is placed at <code>js/WoltLabSuite/Core/Ui/Foo.js</code>, the module name is therefore <code>WoltLabSuite/Core/Ui/Foo</code>, it is automatically derived from the file path and name.</p> <p>For further instructions on how to define and require modules head over to the RequireJS API.</p> <pre><code>define([\"Ajax\", \"WoltLabSuite/Core/Ui/Bar\"], function(Ajax, UiBar) {\n\"use strict\";\n\nfunction Foo() { this.init(); }\nFoo.prototype = {\ninit: function() {\nelBySel(\".myButton\").addEventListener(WCF_CLICK_EVENT, this._click.bind(this));\n},\n\n_click: function(event) {\nevent.preventDefault();\n\nif (UiBar.isSnafucated()) {\nAjax.api(this);\n}\n},\n\n_ajaxSuccess: function(data) {\nconsole.log(\"Received response\", data);\n},\n\n_ajaxSetup: function() {\nreturn {\ndata: {\nactionName: \"makeSnafucated\",\nclassName: \"wcf\\\\data\\\\foo\\\\FooAction\"\n}\n};\n}\n}\n\nreturn Foo;\n});\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"javascript/new-api_writing-a-module/#loading-a-module","title":"Loading a Module","text":"<p>Modules can then be loaded through their derived name:</p> <pre><code>&lt;script data-relocate=\"true\"&gt;\nrequire([\"WoltLabSuite/Core/Ui/Foo\"], function(UiFoo) {\nnew UiFoo();\n});\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"javascript/new-api_writing-a-module/#module-aliases","title":"Module Aliases","text":"<p>Some common modules have short-hand aliases that can be used to include them without writing out their full name.

The <code>$parameters</code> array was introduced due to limitations of this pattern, avoiding moving all the values that might be of interest to the event listener into the state of the object. Events were still tightly coupled with the class that fired the event and using the opaque parameters array prevented IDEs from assisting with autocompletion and typing.</p> <p>WoltLab Suite 5.5 introduces the concept of dedicated, reusable event classes. Any newly introduced event will receive a dedicated class, implementing the <code>wcf\\system\\event\\IEvent</code> interface. These event classes may be fired from multiple locations, making them reusable to convey that a conceptual action happened, instead of a specific class doing something. An example for using the new event system could be a user logging in: Instead of listening on a the login form being submitted and the Facebook login action successfully running, an event <code>UserLoggedIn</code> might be fired whenever a user logs in, no matter how the login is performed.</p> <p>Additionally, these dedicated event classes will benefit from full IDE support. All the relevant values may be stored as real properties on the event object.</p> <p>Event classes should not have an <code>Event</code> suffix and should be stored in an <code>event</code> namespace in a matching location. Thus, the <code>UserLoggedIn</code> example might have a FQCN of <code>\\wcf\\system\\user\\authentication\\event\\UserLoggedIn</code>.</p> <p>Event listeners for events implementing <code>IEvent</code> need to follow PSR-14, i.e. they need to be callable.

Dialogs make it incredibly easy to add extra information or forms to an existing page without giving much thought: A simple button is all that it takes to show a dialog.</p> <p>This has lead to an abundance of dialogs that have been used in a lot of places where dialogs are not the right choice, something we are guilty of in a lot of cases. A lot of research has gone into the accessibility of dialogs and the general recommendations towards their usage and the behavior.</p> <p>One big issue of dialogs have been their inconsistent appearance in terms of form buttons and their (lack of) keyboard support for input fields.

Dialogs completely interrupt whatever the user is doing and can sometimes even hide contextual relevant content on the page. It is best to embed information into regular pages and either use deep links to refer to them or make use of flyovers to present the content in place.</p> <p>Another important change is the handling of form inputs. Previously it was required to manually craft the form submit buttons, handle button clicks and implement a proper validation. The new API provides the \u201cprompt\u201d type which implements all this for you and exposing JavaScript events to validate, submit and cancel the dialog.</p> <p>Last but not least there have been updates to the visual appearance of dialogs. The new dialogs mimic the appearance on modern desktop operating systems as well as smartphones by aligning the buttons to the bottom right. In addition the order of buttons has been changed to always show the primary button on the rightmost position.

Brand icons had been moved to a separate font in Font Awesome 5, but since more and more fonts are being added we have stepped back from relying on that font.

This is problematic, because this makes the boot dependent on the HTTP environment which may not be be available, e.g. when using the CLI interface for maintenance jobs. The latter needs to emulate certain aspects of the HTTP environment for the boot to succeed. Furthermore one of the goals of the introduction of PSR-7/PSR-15-based request processing that was started in WoltLab Suite 5.5 is the removal of implicit global state in favor of explicitly provided values by means of a <code>ServerRequestInterface</code> and thus to achieve a cleaner architecture.</p> <p>To achieve a clean separation this type of request-specific logic will incrementally be moved out of the application boot in <code>WCF</code>\u2019s constructor and into the request processing stack that is launched by <code>RequestHandler</code>, e.g. by running appropriate PSR-15 middleware.</p> <p>An example of this type of request-specific logic that was previously happening during application boot is the check that verifies whether a user is banned and denies access otherwise. This check is based on a request-specific value, namely the user\u2019s session which in turn is based on a provided (HTTP) cookie. It is now moved into the <code>CheckUserBan</code> middleware.</p> <p>This move implies that custom scripts that include WoltLab Suite Core\u2019s <code>global.php</code>, without also invoking <code>RequestHandler</code> will no longer be able to rely on this type of access control having happened and will need to implement it themselves, e.g. by manually running the appropriate middlewares.</p> <p>Notably the following checks have been moved into a middleware:</p> <ul> <li>Denying access to banned users (WoltLab/WCF#4935)</li> <li>ACP authentication (WoltLab/WCF#4939)</li> </ul> <p>The initialization of the session itself and dependent subsystems (e.g. the user object and thus the current language) is still running during application boot for now. However it is planned to also move the session initialization into the middleware in a future version and then providing access to the session by adding an attribute on the <code>ServerRequestInterface</code>, instead of querying the session via <code>WCF::getSession()</code>. As such you should begin to stop relying on the session and user outside of <code>RequestHandler</code>\u2019s middleware stack and should also avoid calling <code>WCF::getUser()</code> and <code>WCF::getSession()</code> outside of a controller, instead adding a <code>User</code> parameter to your methods to allow an appropriate user to be passed from the outside.</p> <p>An example of a method that implicitly relies on these global values is the VisitTracker's <code>trackObjectVisit()</code> method. It only takes the object type, object ID and timestamp as the parameter and will determine the <code>userID</code> by itself. The <code>trackObjectVisitByUserIDs()</code> method on the other hand does not rely on global values. Instead the relevant user IDs need to be passed explicitly from the controller as parameters, thus making the information the method works with explicit. This also makes the method reusable for use cases where an object should be marked as visited for a user other than the active user, without needing to temporarily switch the active user in the session.</p> <p>The same is true for \u201cpermission checking\u201d methods on <code>DatabaseObject</code>s. Instead of having a <code>$myObject-&gt;canView()</code> method that uses <code>WCF::getSession()</code> or <code>WCF::getUser()</code> internally, the user should explicitly be passed to the method as a parameter, allowing for permission checks to happen in a different context, for example send sending notification emails.</p> <p>Likewise event listeners should not access these request-specific values at all, because they are unable to know whether the event was fired based on these request-specific values or whether some programmatic action fired the event for another arbitrary user. Instead they must retrieve the appropriate information from the event data only.</p>"},{"location":"migration/wsc55/php/#bootstrap-scripts","title":"Bootstrap Scripts","text":"<p>WoltLab Suite 6.0 adds package-specific bootstrap scripts allowing a package to execute logic during the application boot to prepare the environment before the request is passed through the middleware pipeline into the controller in <code>RequestHandler</code>.</p> <p>Bootstrap scripts are stored in the <code>lib/bootstrap/</code> directory of WoltLab Suite Core with the package identifier as the file name.

WoltLab Suite included a feature to group digits within large numbers since early versions using the <code>StringUtil::addThousandsSeparator()</code> method. While this method was able to account for some language-specific differences, e.g. by selecting an appropriate separator character based on a phrase, it failed to account for all the differences in number formatting across countries and cultures.</p> <p>As an example, English as written in the United States of America uses commas to create groups of three digits within large numbers: 123,456,789. English as written in India on the other hand also uses commas, but digits are not grouped into groups of three. Instead the right-most three digits form a group and then another comma is added every two digits: 12,34,56,789.</p> <p>Another example would be German as used within Germany and Switzerland. While both countries use groups of three, the separator character differs. Germany uses a dot (123.456.789), whereas Switzerland uses an apostrophe (123\u2019456\u2019789). The correct choice of separator could already be configured using the afore-mentioned phrase, but this is both inconvenient and fails to account for other differences between the two countries. It also made it hard to keep the behavior up to date when rules change.</p> <p>PHP\u2019s intl extension on the other hand builds on the official Unicode rules, by relying on the ICU library published by the Unicode consortium. As such it is aware of the rules of all relevant languages and regions of the world and it is already kept up to date by the operating system\u2019s package manager.</p> <p>For the four example regions (en_US, en_IN, de_DE, de_CH) intl\u2019s <code>NumberFormatter</code> class will format the number 123456789 as follows, correctly implementing the rules:</p> <pre><code>php &gt; var_dump((new NumberFormatter('en_US', \\NumberFormatter::DEFAULT_STYLE))-&gt;format(123_456_789));\nstring(11) \"123,456,789\"\nphp &gt; var_dump((new NumberFormatter('en_IN', \\NumberFormatter::DEFAULT_STYLE))-&gt;format(123_456_789));\nstring(12) \"12,34,56,789\"\nphp &gt; var_dump((new NumberFormatter('de_DE', \\NumberFormatter::DEFAULT_STYLE))-&gt;format(123_456_789));\nstring(11) \"123.456.789\"\nphp &gt; var_dump((new NumberFormatter('de_CH', \\NumberFormatter::DEFAULT_STYLE))-&gt;format(123_456_789));\nstring(15) \"123\u2019456\u2019789\"\n</code></pre> <p>WoltLab Suite\u2019s <code>StringUtil::formatNumeric()</code> method is updated to leverage the <code>NumberFormatter</code> internally.

Unfortunately, this completely ignores the fact that both a single query can take down your app (e. g. full table scan on millions of rows), but 10 queries using a primary key on a table with a few hundred rows will not slow down your page.</p> <p>There are some queries that should go into caches by design, but most of the cache builders weren't initially there, but instead have been added because they were required to reduce the load significantly. You need to understand that caches always come at a cost, even a runtime cache does! In particular, they will always consume memory that is not released over the duration of the request lifecycle and potentially even leak memory by holding references to objects and data structures that are no longer required.</p> <p>Caching should always be a solution for a problem.</p>"},{"location":"php/api/caches/#when-to-use-a-cache","title":"When to Use a Cache","text":"<p>It's difficult to provide a definite answer or checklist when to use a cache and why it is required at this point, because the answer is: It depends. The permission cache for user groups is a good example for a valid cache, where we can achieve significant performance improvement compared to processing this data on every request.</p> <p>Its caches are build for each permutation of user group memberships that are encountered for a page request. Building this data is an expensive process that involves both inheritance and specific rules in regards to when a value for a permission overrules another value. The added benefit of this cache is that one cache usually serves a large number of users with the same group memberships and by computing these permissions once, we can serve many different requests. Also, the permissions are rather static values that change very rarely and thus we can expect a very high cache lifetime before it gets rebuild.</p>"},{"location":"php/api/caches/#when-not-to-use-a-cache","title":"When not to Use a Cache","text":"<p>I remember, a few years ago, there was a plugin that displayed a user's character from an online video game. The character sheet not only included a list of basic statistics, but also displayed the items that this character was wearing and or holding at the time.</p> <p>The data for these items were downloaded in bulk from the game's vendor servers and stored in a persistent cache file that periodically gets renewed. There is nothing wrong with the idea of caching the data on your own server rather than requesting them everytime from the vendor's servers - not only because they imposed a limit on the number of requests per hour.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the character sheet had a sub-par performance and the users were upset by the significant loading times compared to literally every other page on the same server. The author of the plugin was working hard to resolve this issue and was evaluating all kind of methods to improve the page performance, including deep-diving into the realm of micro-optimizations to squeeze out every last bit of performance that is possible.</p> <p>The real problem was the cache file itself, it turns out that it was holding the data for several thousand items with a total file size of about 13 megabytes. It doesn't look that much at first glance, after all this isn't the '90s anymore, but unserializing a 13 megabyte array is really slow and looking up items in such a large array isn't exactly fast either.</p> <p>The solution was rather simple, the data that was fetched from the vendor's API was instead written into a separate database table. Next, the persistent cache was removed and the character sheet would now request the item data for that specific character straight from the database. Previously, the character sheet took several seconds to load and after the change it was done in a fraction of a second. Although quite extreme, this illustrates a situation where the cache file was introduced in the design process, without evaluating if the cache - at least how it was implemented - was really necessary.</p> <p>Caching should always be a solution for a problem.

In this case, the value of the method's first parameter is the <code>ExampleComponent</code> object passed as the first argument of the <code>EventHandler::fireAction()</code> call in <code>ExampleComponent::getVar()</code>. As <code>ExampleComponent::$var</code> is a public property, the event listener code can change it and set it to <code>2</code>.</p> <p>If you now execute the example code from above again, the output will change from <code>var is 1!</code> to <code>var is 2!</code> because prior to returning the value, the event listener code changes the value from <code>1</code> to <code>2</code>.</p> <p>This introductory example illustrates how event listeners can change data in a non-intrusive way.

We will assume that users are able to do both, create and edit the objects via this form. The points in the program flow of AbstractForm that are relevant here are:</p> <ul> <li>adding object (after the form has been submitted):</li> <li>reading the value of the field</li> <li>validating the read value</li> <li> <p>saving the additional value after successful validation and resetting locally stored value or assigning the current value of the field to the template after unsuccessful validation</p> </li> <li> <p>editing object:</p> </li> <li>on initial form request:<ol> <li>reading the pre-existing value of the edited object</li> <li>assigning the field value to the template</li> </ol> </li> <li>after the form has been submitted:<ol> <li>reading the value of the field</li> <li>validating the read value</li> <li>saving the additional value after successful validation</li> <li>assigning the current value of the field to the template</li> </ol> </li> </ul> <p>All of these cases can be covered the by following code in which we assume that <code>wcf\\form\\ExampleAddForm</code> is the form to create example objects and that <code>wcf\\form\\ExampleEditForm</code> extends <code>wcf\\form\\ExampleAddForm</code> and is used for editing existing example objects.</p> files/lib/system/event/listener/ExampleAddFormListener.class.php <pre><code>&lt;?php\nnamespace wcf\\system\\event\\listener;\nuse wcf\\form\\ExampleAddForm;\nuse wcf\\form\\ExampleEditForm;\nuse wcf\\system\\exception\\UserInputException;\nuse wcf\\system\\WCF;\n\nclass ExampleAddFormListener implements IParameterizedEventListener {\n    protected $var = 0;\n\n    public function execute($eventObj, $className, $eventName, array &amp;$parameters) {\n        $this-&gt;$eventName($eventObj);\n    }\n\n    protected function assignVariables() {\n        WCF::getTPL()-&gt;assign('var', $this-&gt;var);\n    }\n\n    protected function readData(ExampleEditForm $eventObj) {\n        if (empty($_POST)) {\n            $this-&gt;var = $eventObj-&gt;example-&gt;var;\n        }\n    }\n\n    protected function readFormParameters() {\n        if (isset($_POST['var'])) $this-&gt;var = intval($_POST['var']);\n    }\n\n    protected function save(ExampleAddForm $eventObj) {\n        $eventObj-&gt;additionalFields = array_merge($eventObj-&gt;additionalFields, ['var' =&gt; $this-&gt;var]);\n    }\n\n    protected function saved() {\n        $this-&gt;var = 0;\n    }\n\n    protected function validate() {\n        if ($this-&gt;var &lt; 0) {\n            throw new UserInputException('var', 'isNegative');\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>execute</code> method in this example just delegates the call to a method with the same name as the event so that this class mimics the structure of a form class itself. The form object is passed to the methods but is only given in the method signatures as a parameter here whenever the form object is actually used. Furthermore, the type-hinting of the parameter illustrates in which contexts the method is actually called which will become clear in the following discussion of the individual methods:</p> <ul> <li><code>assignVariables()</code> is called for the add and the edit form and simply assigns the current value of the variable to the template.</li> <li><code>readData()</code> reads the pre-existing value of <code>$var</code> if the form has not been submitted and thus is only relevant when editing objects which is illustrated by the explicit type-hint of <code>ExampleEditForm</code>.</li> <li><code>readFormParameters()</code> reads the value for both, the add and the edit form.</li> <li><code>save()</code> is, of course, also relevant in both cases but requires the form object to store the additional value in the <code>wcf\\form\\AbstractForm::$additionalFields</code> array which can be used if a <code>var</code> column has been added to the database table in which the example objects are stored.</li> <li><code>saved()</code> is only called for the add form as it clears the internal value so that in the <code>assignVariables()</code> call, the default value will be assigned to the template to create an \"empty\" form.   During edits, this current value is the actual value that should be shown.</li> <li><code>validate()</code> also needs to be called in both cases as the input data always has to be validated.</li> </ul> <p>Lastly, the following XML file has to be used to register the event listeners (you can find more information about how to register event listeners on the eventListener package installation plugin page):</p> eventListener.xml <pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;data xmlns=\"http://www.woltlab.com\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.woltlab.com http://www.woltlab.com/XSD/2019/eventListener.xsd\"&gt;\n&lt;import&gt;\n&lt;eventlistener name=\"exampleAddInherited\"&gt;\n&lt;eventclassname&gt;wcf\\form\\ExampleAddForm&lt;/eventclassname&gt;\n&lt;eventname&gt;assignVariables,readFormParameters,save,validate&lt;/eventname&gt;\n&lt;listenerclassname&gt;wcf\\system\\event\\listener\\ExampleAddFormListener&lt;/listenerclassname&gt;\n&lt;inherit&gt;1&lt;/inherit&gt;\n&lt;/eventlistener&gt;\n\n&lt;eventlistener name=\"exampleAdd\"&gt;\n&lt;eventclassname&gt;wcf\\form\\ExampleAddForm&lt;/eventclassname&gt;\n&lt;eventname&gt;saved&lt;/eventname&gt;\n&lt;listenerclassname&gt;wcf\\system\\event\\listener\\ExampleAddFormListener&lt;/listenerclassname&gt;\n&lt;/eventlistener&gt;\n\n&lt;eventlistener name=\"exampleEdit\"&gt;\n&lt;eventclassname&gt;wcf\\form\\ExampleEditForm&lt;/eventclassname&gt;\n&lt;eventname&gt;readData&lt;/eventname&gt;\n&lt;listenerclassname&gt;wcf\\system\\event\\listener\\ExampleAddFormListener&lt;/listenerclassname&gt;\n&lt;/eventlistener&gt;\n&lt;/import&gt;\n&lt;/data&gt;\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"php/api/package_installation_plugins/","title":"Package Installation Plugins","text":"<p>A package installation plugin (PIP) defines the behavior to handle a specific instruction during package installation, update or uninstallation.</p>"},{"location":"php/api/package_installation_plugins/#abstractpackageinstallationplugin","title":"<code>AbstractPackageInstallationPlugin</code>","text":"<p>Any package installation plugin has to implement the IPackageInstallationPlugin interface.

This sitemap contains all static pages registered via the page package installation plugin and which may be indexed by search engines (checking the <code>allowSpidersToIndex</code> parameter and page permissions) and do not expect an object ID. Other pages have to be added to the sitemap as a separate object.</p> <p>The only prerequisite for sitemap objects is that the objects are instances of <code>wcf\\data\\DatabaseObject</code> and that there is a <code>wcf\\data\\DatabaseObjectList</code> implementation.</p> <p>First, we implement the PHP class, which provides us all database objects and optionally checks the permissions for a single object. The class must implement the interface <code>wcf\\system\\sitemap\\object\\ISitemapObjectObjectType</code>. However, in order to have some methods already implemented and ensure backwards compatibility, you should use the abstract class <code>wcf\\system\\sitemap\\object\\AbstractSitemapObjectObjectType</code>. The abstract class takes care of generating the <code>DatabaseObjectList</code> class name and list directly and implements optional methods with the default values. The only method that you have to implement yourself is the <code>getObjectClass()</code> method which returns the fully qualified name of the <code>DatabaseObject</code> class. The <code>DatabaseObject</code> class must implement the interface <code>wcf\\data\\ILinkableObject</code>.</p> <p>Other optional methods are:</p> <ul> <li>The <code>getLastModifiedColumn()</code> method returns the name of the column in the database where the last modification date is stored.   If there is none, this method must return <code>null</code>.</li> <li>The <code>canView()</code> method checks whether the passed <code>DatabaseObject</code> is visible to the current user with the current user always being a guest.</li> <li>The <code>getObjectListClass()</code> method returns a non-standard <code>DatabaseObjectList</code> class name.</li> <li>The <code>getObjectList()</code> method returns the <code>DatabaseObjectList</code> instance.   You can, for example, specify additional query conditions in the method.</li> </ul> <p>As an example, the implementation for users looks like this:</p> files/lib/system/sitemap/object/UserSitemapObject.class.php <pre><code>&lt;?php\nnamespace wcf\\system\\sitemap\\object;\nuse wcf\\data\\user\\User;\nuse wcf\\data\\DatabaseObject;\nuse wcf\\system\\WCF;\n\n/**\n * User sitemap implementation.\n *\n * @author  Joshua Ruesweg\n * @copyright   2001-2017 WoltLab GmbH\n * @license GNU Lesser General Public License &lt;http://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php&gt;\n * @package WoltLabSuite\\Core\\Sitemap\\Object\n * @since   3.1\n */\nclass UserSitemapObject extends AbstractSitemapObjectObjectType {\n    /**\n     * @inheritDoc\n     */\n    public function getObjectClass() {\n        return User::class;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @inheritDoc\n     */\n    public function getLastModifiedColumn() {\n        return 'lastActivityTime';\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @inheritDoc\n     */\n    public function canView(DatabaseObject $object) {\n        return WCF::getSession()-&gt;getPermission('user.profile.canViewUserProfile');\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Next, the sitemap object must be registered as an object type:</p> <pre><code>&lt;type&gt;\n&lt;name&gt;com.example.plugin.sitemap.object.user&lt;/name&gt;\n&lt;definitionname&gt;com.woltlab.wcf.sitemap.object&lt;/definitionname&gt;\n&lt;classname&gt;wcf\\system\\sitemap\\object\\UserSitemapObject&lt;/classname&gt;\n&lt;priority&gt;0.5&lt;/priority&gt;\n&lt;changeFreq&gt;monthly&lt;/changeFreq&gt;\n&lt;rebuildTime&gt;259200&lt;/rebuildTime&gt;\n&lt;/type&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>In addition to the fully qualified class name, the object type definition <code>com.woltlab.wcf.sitemap.object</code> and the object type name, the parameters <code>priority</code>, <code>changeFreq</code> and <code>rebuildTime</code> must also be specified. <code>priority</code> (https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html#prioritydef) and <code>changeFreq</code> (https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html#changefreqdef) are specifications in the sitemaps protocol and can be changed by the user in the ACP.

Stacking of notification does not create new notifications for the same event for a certain object if the related action as been triggered by different users.   For example, if something is liked by one user and then liked again by another user before the recipient of the notification has confirmed it, the existing notification will be amended to include both users who liked the content.   Stacking can thus be used to avoid cluttering the notification list of users.</li> <li>The <code>checkAccess()</code> method makes sure that the active user still has access to the object related to the notification.   If that is not the case, the user notification system will automatically deleted the user notification based on the return value of the method.   If you have any cached values related to notifications, you should also reset these values here.</li> <li>The <code>getEmailMessage()</code> method return data to create the instant email or the daily summary email.   For instant emails (<code>$notificationType = 'instant'</code>), you have to return an array like the one shown in the code above with the following components:</li> <li><code>application</code>:     abbreviation of application</li> <li><code>in-reply-to</code> (optional):     message id of the notification for the parent item and used to improve the ordering in threaded email clients</li> <li><code>message-id</code> (optional):     message id of the notification mail and has to be used in <code>in-reply-to</code> and <code>references</code> for follow up mails</li> <li><code>references</code> (optional):     all of the message ids of parent items (i.e. recursive in-reply-to)</li> <li><code>template</code>:     name of the template used to render the email body, should start with <code>email_</code></li> <li><code>variables</code> (optional):     template variables passed to the email template where they can be accessed via <code>$notificationContent[variables]</code></li> </ul> <p>For daily emails (<code>$notificationType = 'daily'</code>), only <code>application</code>, <code>template</code>, and <code>variables</code> are supported. - The <code>getEmailTitle()</code> returns the title of the instant email sent to the user.   By default, <code>getEmailTitle()</code> simply calls <code>getTitle()</code>. - The <code>getEventHash()</code> method returns a hash by which user notifications are grouped.   Here, we want to group them not by the actual <code>Foo</code> object but by its parent <code>Baz</code> object and thus overwrite the default implementation provided by <code>AbstractUserNotificationEvent</code>. - The <code>getLink()</code> returns the link to the <code>Foo</code> object the notification belongs to. - The <code>getMessage()</code> method and the <code>getTitle()</code> return the message and the title of the user notification respectively.

You have to include this template for every page!</li> <li>We set the content header and additional provide a button to create a new person in the content header navigation.</li> <li>As not all people are listed on the same page if many people have been created, we need a pagination for which we use the <code>pages</code> template plugin.    The <code>{hascontent}{content}{/content}{/hascontent}</code> construct ensures the <code>.paginationTop</code> element is only shown if the <code>pages</code> template plugin has a return value, thus if a pagination is necessary.</li> <li>Now comes the main part of the page, the list of the people, which will only be displayed if any people exist.    Otherwise, an info box is displayed using the generic <code>wcf.global.noItems</code> language item.    The <code>$objects</code> template variable is automatically assigned by <code>wcf\\page\\MultipleLinkPage</code> and contains the <code>PersonList</code> object used to read the people from database.    The table itself consists of a <code>thead</code> and a <code>tbody</code> element and is extendable with more columns using the template events <code>columnHeads</code> and <code>columns</code>.    In general, every table should provide these events.    The default structure of a table is used here so that the first column of the content rows contains icons to edit and to delete the row (and provides another standard event <code>rowButtons</code>) and that the second column contains the ID of the person.    The table can be sorted by clicking on the head of each column.    The used variables <code>$sortField</code> and <code>$sortOrder</code> are automatically assigned to the template by <code>SortablePage</code>.</li> <li>The <code>.contentFooter</code> element is only shown if people exist as it basically repeats the <code>.contentHeaderNavigation</code> and <code>.paginationTop</code> element.</li> <li>The delete button for each person shown in the <code>.columnIcon</code> element relies on the global <code>WoltLabSuite/Core/Ui/Object/Action</code> module which only requires the <code>jsObjectActionContainer</code> CSS class in combination with the <code>data-object-action-class-name</code> attribute for the <code>table</code> element, the <code>jsObjectActionObject</code> CSS class for each person's <code>tr</code> element in combination with the <code>data-object-id</code> attribute, and lastly the delete button itself, which is created with the <code>objectAction</code> template plugin.</li> <li>The <code>.jsReloadPageWhenEmpty</code> CSS class on the <code>tbody</code> element ensures that once all persons on the page have been deleted, the page is reloaded.</li> <li>Lastly, the <code>footer</code> template is included that terminates the page.    You also have to include this template for every page!</li> </ol> <p>Now, we have finished the page to manage the people so that we can move on to the forms with which we actually create and edit the

Furthermore, we include a template called <code>header</code> before actually showing any of the page contents and terminate the template by including the <code>footer</code> template.</p> <p>Now, let us take a closer look at the differences:</p> <ul> <li>We do not explicitly create a <code>.contentHeader</code> element but simply assign the title to the <code>contentTitle</code> variable.   The value of the assignment is simply the title of the page and a badge showing the number of listed people.   The <code>header</code> template that we include later will handle correctly displaying the content header on its own based on the <code>$contentTitle</code> variable.</li> <li>Next, we create additional element for the HTML document\u2019s <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element.   In this case, we define the canonical link of the page and, because we are showing paginated content, add links to the previous and next page (if they exist).</li> <li>We want the page to be sortable but as we will not be using a table for listing the people like in the ACP, we are not able to place links to sort the people into the table head.   Instead, usually a box is created in the sidebar on the right-hand side that contains <code>select</code> elements to determine sort field and sort order.</li> <li>The main part of the page is the listing of the people.   We use a structure similar to the one used for displaying registered users.   Here, for each person, we simply display a FontAwesome icon representing a person and show the person\u2019s full name relying on <code>Person::__toString()</code>.   Additionally, like in the user list, we provide the initially empty <code>ul.inlineList.commaSeparated</code> and <code>dl.plain.inlineDataList.small</code> elements that can be filled by plugins using the templates events. </li> </ul>"},{"location":"tutorial/series/part_1/#usergroupoptionxml","title":"<code>userGroupOption.xml</code>","text":"<p>We have already used the <code>admin.content.canManagePeople</code> permissions several times, now we need to install it using the userGroupOption package installation plugin:</p> userGroupOption.xml <pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;data xmlns=\"http://www.woltlab.com\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.woltlab.com http://www.woltlab.com/XSD/5.4/userGroupOption.xsd\"&gt;\n&lt;import&gt;\n&lt;options&gt;\n&lt;option name=\"admin.content.canManagePeople\"&gt;\n&lt;categoryname&gt;admin.content&lt;/categoryname&gt;\n&lt;optiontype&gt;boolean&lt;/optiontype&gt;\n&lt;defaultvalue&gt;0&lt;/defaultvalue&gt;\n&lt;admindefaultvalue&gt;1&lt;/admindefaultvalue&gt;\n&lt;usersonly&gt;1&lt;/usersonly&gt;\n&lt;/option&gt;\n&lt;/options&gt;\n&lt;/import&gt;\n&lt;/data&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>We use the existing <code>admin.content</code> user group option category for the permission as the people are \u201ccontent\u201d (similar the the ACP menu item).

First, we install the ACP templates, files and templates, create the database table and import the language item. Afterwards, the ACP menu items and the permission are added. Now comes the part of the instructions where the order of the instructions is crucial: In <code>menuItem.xml</code>, we refer to the <code>com.woltlab.wcf.people.PersonList</code> page that is delivered by <code>page.xml</code>. As the menu item package installation plugin validates the given page and throws an exception if the page does not exist, we need to install the page before the menu item! </p> <p>This concludes the first part of our tutorial series after which you now have a working simple package with which you can manage people in the ACP and show the visitors of your website a simple list of all created people in the front end.</p> <p>The complete source code of this part can be found on GitHub.</p>"},{"location":"tutorial/series/part_2/","title":"Part 2: Event and Template Listeners","text":"<p>In the first part of this tutorial series, we have created the base structure of our people management package.

As we want  administrators to link to specific people in menus, for example, we have to also implement the ILookupPageHandler interface by extending the AbstractLookupPageHandler class.</p> <p>For the <code>ILookupPageHandler</code> interface, we need to implement three methods:</p> <ol> <li><code>getLink($objectID)</code> returns the link to the person page with the given id.    In this case, we simply delegate this method call to the <code>Person</code> object returned by <code>PersonRuntimeCache::getObject()</code>.</li> <li><code>isValid($objectID)</code> returns <code>true</code> if the person with the given id exists, otherwise <code>false</code>.    Here, we use <code>PersonRuntimeCache::getObject()</code> again and check if the return value is <code>null</code>, which is the case for non-existing people.</li> <li><code>lookup($searchString)</code> is used when setting up an internal link and when searching for the linked person.    This method simply searches the first and last name of the people and returns an array with the person data.    While the <code>link</code>, the <code>objectID</code>, and the <code>title</code> element are self-explanatory, the <code>image</code> element can either contain an HTML <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag, which is displayed next to the search result (WoltLab Suite uses an image tag for users showing their avatar, for example), or a FontAwesome icon class.</li> </ol> <p>Additionally, the class also implements IOnlineLocationPageHandler which is used to determine the online location of users. To ensure upwards-compatibility if the <code>IOnlineLocationPageHandler</code> interface changes, the TOnlineLocationPageHandler trait is used. The <code>IOnlineLocationPageHandler</code> interface requires two methods to be implemented:</p> <ol> <li><code>getOnlineLocation(Page $page, UserOnline $user)</code> returns the textual description of the online location.    The language item for the user online locations should use the pattern <code>wcf.page.onlineLocation.{page identifier}</code>.</li> <li><code>prepareOnlineLocation(Page $page, UserOnline $user)</code> is called for each user online before the <code>getOnlineLocation()</code> calls.    In this case, calling <code>prepareOnlineLocation()</code> first enables us to add all relevant person ids to the person runtime cache so that for all <code>getOnlineLocation()</code> calls combined, only one database query is necessary to fetch all person objects.</li> </ol> <p>This concludes the third part of our tutorial series after which each person has a dedicated page on which people can comment on the person.</p> <p>The complete source code of this part can be found on GitHub.</p>"},{"location":"tutorial/series/part_4/","title":"Part 4: Box and Box Conditions","text":"<p>In this part of our tutorial series, we add support for creating boxes listing people.</p>"},{"location":"tutorial/series/part_4/#package-functionality","title":"Package Functionality","text":"<p>In addition to the existing functions from part 3, the package will provide the following functionality after this part of the tutorial:</p> <ul> <li>Creating boxes dynamically listing people</li> <li>Filtering the people listed in boxes using conditions</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tutorial/series/part_4/#used-components","title":"Used Components","text":"<p>In addition to the components used in previous parts, we will use the <code>objectTypeDefinition</code> package installation plugin and use the box and condition APIs.</p> <p>To pre-install a specific person list box, we refer to the documentation of the <code>box</code> package installation plugin.</p>"},{"location":"tutorial/series/part_4/#package-structure","title":"Package Structure","text":"<p>The complete package will have the following file structure (excluding unchanged files from part 3):</p> <pre><code>\u251c\u2500\u2500 files\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 lib\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 system\n\u2502           \u251c\u2500\u2500 box\n\u2502           \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 PersonListBoxController.class.php\n\u2502           \u2514\u2500\u2500 condition\n\u2502               \u2514\u2500\u2500 person\n\u2502                   \u251c\u2500\u2500 PersonFirstNameTextPropertyCondition.class.php\n\u2502                   \u2514\u2500\u2500 PersonLastNameTextPropertyCondition.class.php\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 language\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 de.xml\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 en.xml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 objectType.xml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 objectTypeDefinition.xml\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 templates\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 boxPersonList.tpl\n</code></pre> <p>For all changes, please refer to the source code on GitHub.</p>"},{"location":"tutorial/series/part_4/#box-controller","title":"Box Controller","text":"<p>In addition to static boxes with fixed contents, administrators are able to create dynamic boxes with contents from the database.

In both cases, it is checked if the current user has created the relevant piece of information to check the user-specific permissions or to fall back to the moderator-specific permissions.</p> <p>There also two getter methods for the person, the piece of information belongs to (<code>getPerson()</code>), and for the user profile of the user who created the information (<code>getUserProfile()</code>). In both cases, we use runtime caches, though in <code>getUserProfile()</code>, we also have to consider the case of the user who created the information being deleted, i.e. <code>userID</code> being <code>null</code>. For such a case, we also save the name of the user who created the information in <code>username</code>, so that we can return a guest user profile object in this case. The most interesting method is <code>getFormattedInformation()</code>, which returns the HTML code of the information text meant for output. To generate such an output, <code>HtmlOutputProcessor::process()</code> is used and here is where we first use the associated message object type <code>com.woltlab.wcf.people.information</code> mentioned before.</p> <p>While <code>PersonInformationEditor</code> is simply the default implementation and thus not explicitly shown here, <code>PersonInformationList::readObjects()</code> caches the relevant ids of the associated people and users who created the pieces of information using runtime caches:</p> files/lib/data/person/information/PersonInformationList.class.php

Additionally, we always list all pieces of information. If there are many pieces of information, a nicer solution would be a pagination or loading more pieces of information with JavaScript.</p> <p>First, we note the <code>jsObjectActionContainer</code> class in combination with the <code>data-object-action-class-name</code> attribute, which are needed for the delete button for each piece of information, as explained here. In <code>PersonInformationAction</code>, we have overridden the default implementations of <code>validateDelete()</code> and <code>delete()</code> which are called after clicking on a delete button. In <code>validateDelete()</code>, we call <code>PersonInformation::canDelete()</code> on all pieces of information to be deleted for proper permission validation, and in <code>delete()</code>, we update the <code>informationCount</code> values of the people the deleted pieces of information belong to (see below).</p> <p>The button to add a new piece of information, <code>#personInformationAddButton</code>, and the buttons to edit existing pieces of information, <code>.jsEditInformation</code>, are controlled with JavaScript code initialized at the very end of the template.</p> <p>Lastly, in <code>create()</code> we provide default values for the <code>time</code>, <code>userID</code>, <code>username</code>, and <code>ipAddress</code> for cases like here when creating a new piece of information, where do not explicitly provide this data. Additionally, we extract the information text from the <code>information_htmlInputProcessor</code> parameter provided by the associated WYSIWYG form field and update the number of pieces of information created for the relevant person.</p>"},{"location":"tutorial/series/part_5/#creating-and-editing-person-information","title":"Creating and Editing Person Information","text":"<p>To create new pieces of information or editing existing ones, we do not add new form controllers but instead use dialogs generated by the form builder API so that the user does not have to leave the person page.</p> <p>When clicking on the add button or on any of the edit buttons, a dialog opens with the relevant form:</p> ts/WoltLabSuite/Core/Controller/Person.ts <pre><code>/**\n * Provides the JavaScript code for the person page.\n *\n * @author  Matthias Schmidt\n * @copyright  2001-2021 WoltLab GmbH\n * @license  GNU Lesser General Public License &lt;http://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php&gt;\n * @module  WoltLabSuite/Core/Controller/Person\n */\n\nimport FormBuilderDialog from \"WoltLabSuite/Core/Form/Builder/Dialog\";\nimport * as Language from \"WoltLabSuite/Core/Language\";\nimport * as UiNotification from \"WoltLabSuite/Core/Ui/Notification\";\n\nlet addDialog: FormBuilderDialog;\nconst editDialogs = new Map&lt;string, FormBuilderDialog&gt;();\n\ninterface EditReturnValues {\nformattedInformation: string;\ninformationID: number;\n}\n\ninterface Options {\ncanAddInformation: true;\n}\n\n/**\n * Opens the edit dialog after clicking on the edit button for a piece of information.\n */\nfunction editInformation(event: Event): void {\nevent.preventDefault();\n\nconst currentTarget = event.currentTarget as HTMLElement;\nconst information = currentTarget.closest(\".jsObjectActionObject\") as HTMLElement;\nconst informationId = information.dataset.objectId!;\n\nif (!editDialogs.has(informationId)) {\neditDialogs.set(\ninformationId,\nnew FormBuilderDialog(\n`personInformationEditDialog${informationId}`,\n\"wcf\\\\data\\\\person\\\\information\\\\PersonInformationAction\",\n\"getEditDialog\",\n{\nactionParameters: {\ninformationID: informationId,\n},\ndialog: {\ntitle: Language.get(\"wcf.person.information.edit\"),\n},\nsubmitActionName: \"submitEditDialog\",\nsuccessCallback(returnValues: EditReturnValues) {\ndocument.getElementById(`personInformation${returnValues.informationID}`)!.innerHTML =\nreturnValues.formattedInformation;\n\nUiNotification.show(Language.get(\"wcf.person.information.edit.success\"));\n},\n},\n),\n);\n}\n\neditDialogs.get(informationId)!.open();\n}\n\n/**\n * Initializes the JavaScript code for the person page.\n */\nexport function init(personId: number, options: Options): void {\nif (options.canAddInformation) {\n// Initialize the dialog to add new information.\naddDialog = new FormBuilderDialog(\n\"personInformationAddDialog\",\n\"wcf\\\\data\\\\person\\\\information\\\\PersonInformationAction\",\n\"getAddDialog\",\n{\nactionParameters: {\npersonID: personId,\n},\ndialog: {\ntitle: Language.get(\"wcf.person.information.add\"),\n},\nsubmitActionName: \"submitAddDialog\",\nsuccessCallback() {\nUiNotification.show(Language.get(\"wcf.person.information.add.success\"), () =&gt; window.location.reload());\n},\n},\n);\n\ndocument.getElementById(\"personInformationAddButton\")!.addEventListener(\"click\", (event) =&gt; {\nevent.preventDefault();\n\naddDialog.open();\n});\n}\n\ndocument\n.querySelectorAll(\".jsEditInformation\")\n.forEach((el) =&gt; el.addEventListener(\"click\", (ev) =&gt; editInformation(ev)));\n}\n</code></pre> <p>We use the <code>WoltLabSuite/Core/Form/Builder/Dialog</code> module, which takes care of the internal handling with regard to these dialogs.

In addition to these two methods, the matching validation methods <code>validateGetAddDialog()</code> and <code>validateGetAddDialog()</code> are also added. As the forms for adding and editing pieces of information have the same structure, this form is created in <code>buildDialog()</code> using a <code>DialogFormDocument</code> object, which is intended for forms in dialogs. We fire an event in <code>buildDialog()</code> so that plugins are able to easily extend the dialog with additional data.</p> <p><code>validateGetAddDialog()</code> checks if the user has the permission to create new pieces of information and if a valid id for the person, the information will belong to, is given.  The method configured in the <code>WoltLabSuite/Core/Form/Builder/Dialog</code> object returning the dialog is expected to return two values: the id of the form (<code>formId</code>) and the contents of form shown in the dialog (<code>dialog</code>). This data is returned by <code>getAddDialog</code> using the dialog build previously by <code>buildDialog()</code>.</p> <p>After the form is submitted, <code>validateSubmitAddDialog()</code> has to do the same basic validation as <code>validateGetAddDialog()</code> so that <code>validateGetAddDialog()</code> is simply called. Additionally, the form data is read and validated. In <code>submitAddDialog()</code>, we first check if there have been any validation errors: If any error occured during validation, we return the same data as in <code>getAddDialog()</code> so that the dialog is shown again with the erroneous fields marked as such. Otherwise, if the validation succeeded, the form data is used to create the new piece of information. In addition to the form data, we manually add the id of the person to whom the information belongs to. Lastly, we could return some data that we could access in the JavaScript callback function after successfully submitting the dialog. As we will simply be reloading the page, no such data is returned.
