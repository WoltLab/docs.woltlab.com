This extra code illustrates the separation of data processing that takes place within all sort of pages, where all user-supplied data is read from within a single method. It helps organizing the code, but most of all it enforces a clean class logic that does not start reading user input at random places, including the risk to only escape the input of variable <code>$_GET['foo']</code> 4 out of 5 times.</p> <p>Reading and processing the data is only half the story, now we need a template to display the actual content for our page. You don't need to specify it yourself, it will be automatically guessed based on your namespace and class name, you can read more about it later.</p> <p>Last but not least, you must not include the closing PHP tag <code>?&gt;</code> at the end, it can cause PHP to break on whitespaces and is not required at all.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/#the-template","title":"The Template","text":"<p>Navigate back to the root directory of your package until you see both the <code>files</code> directory and the <code>package.xml</code>.

This has been done to preserve the backwards-compatibility and to avoid the significant amount of work that it requires to rewrite a component. The components invoked on page initialization have all been rewritten to use the modern API, but some deferred objects that are invoked later during the page runtime may still use the old API.</p> <p>However, the legacy API is deprecated and you should not rely on it for new components at all.

The previously used API heavily relied on larger JavaScript files that contained a lot of different components with hidden dependencies and suffered from extensive jQuery usage for historic reasons.</p> <p>Eventually a new API was designed that solves the issues with the legacy API by following a few basic principles:  1. Vanilla ES5-JavaScript.     It allows us to achieve the best performance across all platforms, there is     simply no reason to use jQuery today and the performance penalty on mobile     devices is a real issue.  2. Strict usage of modules.     Each component is placed in an own file and all dependencies are explicitly     declared and injected at the top.Eventually we settled with AMD-style modules     using require.js which offers both lazy loading and \"ahead of time\"-compilatio     with <code>r.js</code>.  3. No jQuery-based components on page init.     Nothing is more annoying than loading a page and then wait for JavaScript to     modify the page before it becomes usable, forcing the user to sit and wait.     Heavily optimized vanilla JavaScript components offered the speed we wanted.  4. Limited backwards-compatibility.     The new API should make it easy to update existing components by providing     similar interfaces, while still allowing legacy code to run side-by-side for     best compatibility and to avoid rewritting everything from the start.</p>"},{"location":"javascript/new-api_writing-a-module/#defining-a-module","title":"Defining a Module","text":"<p>The default location for modules is <code>js/</code> in the Core's app dir, but every app and plugin can register their own lookup path by providing the path using a template-listener on <code>requirePaths@headIncludeJavaScript</code>.</p> <p>For this example we'll assume the file is placed at <code>js/WoltLabSuite/Core/Ui/Foo.js</code>, the module name is therefore <code>WoltLabSuite/Core/Ui/Foo</code>, it is automatically derived from the file path and name.</p> <p>For further instructions on how to define and require modules head over to the RequireJS API.</p> <pre><code>define([\"Ajax\", \"WoltLabSuite/Core/Ui/Bar\"], function(Ajax, UiBar) {\n\"use strict\";\n\nfunction Foo() { this.init(); }\nFoo.prototype = {\ninit: function() {\nelBySel(\".myButton\").addEventListener(WCF_CLICK_EVENT, this._click.bind(this));\n},\n\n_click: function(event) {\nevent.preventDefault();\n\nif (UiBar.isSnafucated()) {\nAjax.api(this);\n}\n},\n\n_ajaxSuccess: function(data) {\nconsole.log(\"Received response\", data);\n},\n\n_ajaxSetup: function() {\nreturn {\ndata: {\nactionName: \"makeSnafucated\",\nclassName: \"wcf\\\\data\\\\foo\\\\FooAction\"\n}\n};\n}\n}\n\nreturn Foo;\n});\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"javascript/new-api_writing-a-module/#loading-a-module","title":"Loading a Module","text":"<p>Modules can then be loaded through their derived name:</p> <pre><code>&lt;script data-relocate=\"true\"&gt;\nrequire([\"WoltLabSuite/Core/Ui/Foo\"], function(UiFoo) {\nnew UiFoo();\n});\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"javascript/new-api_writing-a-module/#module-aliases","title":"Module Aliases","text":"<p>Some common modules have short-hand aliases that can be used to include them without writing out their full name.

The <code>$parameters</code> array was introduced due to limitations of this pattern, avoiding moving all the values that might be of interest to the event listener into the state of the object. Events were still tightly coupled with the class that fired the event and using the opaque parameters array prevented IDEs from assisting with autocompletion and typing.</p> <p>WoltLab Suite 5.5 introduces the concept of dedicated, reusable event classes. Any newly introduced event will receive a dedicated class, implementing the <code>wcf\\system\\event\\IEvent</code> interface. These event classes may be fired from multiple locations, making them reusable to convey that a conceptual action happened, instead of a specific class doing something. An example for using the new event system could be a user logging in: Instead of listening on a the login form being submitted and the Facebook login action successfully running, an event <code>UserLoggedIn</code> might be fired whenever a user logs in, no matter how the login is performed.</p> <p>Additionally, these dedicated event classes will benefit from full IDE support. All the relevant values may be stored as real properties on the event object.</p> <p>Event classes should not have an <code>Event</code> suffix and should be stored in an <code>event</code> namespace in a matching location.

You need to understand that caches always come at a cost, even a runtime cache does!

Building this data is an expensive process that involves both inheritance and specific rules in regards to when a value for a permission overrules another value. The added benefit of this cache is that one cache usually serves a large number of users with the same group memberships and by computing these permissions once, we can serve many different requests. Also, the permissions are rather static values that change very rarely and thus we can expect a very high cache lifetime before it gets rebuild.</p>"},{"location":"php/api/caches/#when-not-to-use-a-cache","title":"When not to Use a Cache","text":"<p>I remember, a few years ago, there was a plugin that displayed a user's character from an online video game. The character sheet not only included a list of basic statistics, but also displayed the items that this character was wearing and or holding at the time.</p> <p>The data for these items were downloaded in bulk from the game's vendor servers and stored in a persistent cache file that periodically gets renewed. There is nothing wrong with the idea of caching the data on your own server rather than requesting them everytime from the vendor's servers - not only because they imposed a limit on the number of requests per hour.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the character sheet had a sub-par performance and the users were upset by the significant loading times compared to literally every other page on the same server. The author of the plugin was working hard to resolve this issue and was evaluating all kind of methods to improve the page performance, including deep-diving into the realm of micro-optimizations to squeeze out every last bit of performance that is possible.</p> <p>The real problem was the cache file itself, it turns out that it was holding the data for several thousand items with a total file size of about 13 megabytes. It doesn't look that much at first glance, after all this isn't the '90s anymore, but unserializing a 13 megabyte array is really slow and looking up items in such a large array isn't exactly fast either.</p> <p>The solution was rather simple, the data that was fetched from the vendor's API was instead written into a separate database table. Next, the persistent cache was removed and the character sheet would now request the item data for that specific character straight from the database. Previously, the character sheet took several seconds to load and after the change it was done in a fraction of a second. Although quite extreme, this illustrates a situation where the cache file was introduced in the design process, without evaluating if the cache - at least how it was implemented - was really necessary.</p> <p>Caching should always be a solution for a problem.

The form object is passed to the methods but is only given in the method signatures as a parameter here whenever the form object is actually used. Furthermore, the type-hinting of the parameter illustrates in which contexts the method is actually called which will become clear in the following discussion of the individual methods:</p> <ul> <li><code>assignVariables()</code> is called for the add and the edit form and simply assigns the current value of the variable to the template.</li> <li><code>readData()</code> reads the pre-existing value of <code>$var</code> if the form has not been submitted and thus is only relevant when editing objects which is illustrated by the explicit type-hint of <code>ExampleEditForm</code>.</li> <li><code>readFormParameters()</code> reads the value for both, the add and the edit form.</li> <li><code>save()</code> is, of course, also relevant in both cases but requires the form object to store the additional value in the <code>wcf\\form\\AbstractForm::$additionalFields</code> array which can be used if a <code>var</code> column has been added to the database table in which the example objects are stored.</li> <li><code>saved()</code> is only called for the add form as it clears the internal value so that in the <code>assignVariables()</code> call, the default value will be assigned to the template to create an \"empty\" form.   During edits, this current value is the actual value that should be shown.</li> <li><code>validate()</code> also needs to be called in both cases as the input data always has to be validated.</li> </ul> <p>Lastly, the following XML file has to be used to register the event listeners (you can find more information about how to register event listeners on the eventListener package installation plugin page):</p> eventListener.xml <pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;data xmlns=\"http://www.woltlab.com\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.woltlab.com http://www.woltlab.com/XSD/2019/eventListener.xsd\"&gt;\n&lt;import&gt;\n&lt;eventlistener name=\"exampleAddInherited\"&gt;\n&lt;eventclassname&gt;wcf\\form\\ExampleAddForm&lt;/eventclassname&gt;\n&lt;eventname&gt;assignVariables,readFormParameters,save,validate&lt;/eventname&gt;\n&lt;listenerclassname&gt;wcf\\system\\event\\listener\\ExampleAddFormListener&lt;/listenerclassname&gt;\n&lt;inherit&gt;1&lt;/inherit&gt;\n&lt;/eventlistener&gt;\n\n&lt;eventlistener name=\"exampleAdd\"&gt;\n&lt;eventclassname&gt;wcf\\form\\ExampleAddForm&lt;/eventclassname&gt;\n&lt;eventname&gt;saved&lt;/eventname&gt;\n&lt;listenerclassname&gt;wcf\\system\\event\\listener\\ExampleAddFormListener&lt;/listenerclassname&gt;\n&lt;/eventlistener&gt;\n\n&lt;eventlistener name=\"exampleEdit\"&gt;\n&lt;eventclassname&gt;wcf\\form\\ExampleEditForm&lt;/eventclassname&gt;\n&lt;eventname&gt;readData&lt;/eventname&gt;\n&lt;listenerclassname&gt;wcf\\system\\event\\listener\\ExampleAddFormListener&lt;/listenerclassname&gt;\n&lt;/eventlistener&gt;\n&lt;/import&gt;\n&lt;/data&gt;\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"php/api/package_installation_plugins/","title":"Package Installation Plugins","text":"<p>A package installation plugin (PIP) defines the behavior to handle a specific instruction during package installation, update or uninstallation.</p>"},{"location":"php/api/package_installation_plugins/#abstractpackageinstallationplugin","title":"<code>AbstractPackageInstallationPlugin</code>","text":"<p>Any package installation plugin has to implement the IPackageInstallationPlugin interface.

The class must implement the interface <code>wcf\\system\\sitemap\\object\\ISitemapObjectObjectType</code>. However, in order to have some methods already implemented and ensure backwards compatibility, you should use the abstract class <code>wcf\\system\\sitemap\\object\\AbstractSitemapObjectObjectType</code>. The abstract class takes care of generating the <code>DatabaseObjectList</code> class name and list directly and implements optional methods with the default values. The only method that you have to implement yourself is the <code>getObjectClass()</code> method which returns the fully qualified name of the <code>DatabaseObject</code> class. The <code>DatabaseObject</code> class must implement the interface <code>wcf\\data\\ILinkableObject</code>.</p> <p>Other optional methods are:</p> <ul> <li>The <code>getLastModifiedColumn()</code> method returns the name of the column in the database where the last modification date is stored.

You have to include this template for every page!</li> <li>We set the content header and additional provide a button to create a new person in the content header navigation.</li> <li>As not all people are listed on the same page if many people have been created, we need a pagination for which we use the <code>pages</code> template plugin.    The <code>{hascontent}{content}{/content}{/hascontent}</code> construct ensures the <code>.paginationTop</code> element is only shown if the <code>pages</code> template plugin has a return value, thus if a pagination is necessary.</li> <li>Now comes the main part of the page, the list of the people, which will only be displayed if any people exist.    Otherwise, an info box is displayed using the generic <code>wcf.global.noItems</code> language item.    The <code>$objects</code> template variable is automatically assigned by <code>wcf\\page\\MultipleLinkPage</code> and contains the <code>PersonList</code> object used to read the people from database.    The table itself consists of a <code>thead</code> and a <code>tbody</code> element and is extendable with more columns using the template events <code>columnHeads</code> and <code>columns</code>.    In general, every table should provide these events.    The default structure of a table is used here so that the first column of the content rows contains icons to edit and to delete the row (and provides another standard event <code>rowButtons</code>) and that the second column contains the ID of the person.    The table can be sorted by clicking on the head of each column.    The used variables <code>$sortField</code> and <code>$sortOrder</code> are automatically assigned to the template by <code>SortablePage</code>.</li> <li>The <code>.contentFooter</code> element is only shown if people exist as it basically repeats the <code>.contentHeaderNavigation</code> and <code>.paginationTop</code> element.</li> <li>The delete button for each person shown in the <code>.columnIcon</code> element relies on the global <code>WoltLabSuite/Core/Ui/Object/Action</code> module which only requires the <code>jsObjectActionContainer</code> CSS class in combination with the <code>data-object-action-class-name</code> attribute for the <code>table</code> element, the <code>jsObjectActionObject</code> CSS class for each person's <code>tr</code> element in combination with the <code>data-object-id</code> attribute, and lastly the delete button itself, which is created with the <code>objectAction</code> template plugin.</li> <li>The <code>.jsReloadPageWhenEmpty</code> CSS class on the <code>tbody</code> element ensures that once all persons on the page have been deleted, the page is reloaded.</li> <li>Lastly, the <code>footer</code> template is included that terminates the page.    You also have to include this template for every page!</li> </ol> <p>Now, we have finished the page to manage the people so that we can move on to the forms with which we actually create and edit the people.</p>"},{"location":"tutorial/series/part_1/#person-add-form","title":"Person Add Form","text":"<p>Like the person list, the form to add new people requires a controller class and a template.</p>"},{"location":"tutorial/series/part_1/#personaddform","title":"<code>PersonAddForm</code>","text":"files/lib/acp/form/PersonAddForm.class.php <pre><code>&lt;?php\n\nnamespace wcf\\acp\\form;\n\nuse wcf\\data\\person\\PersonAction;\nuse wcf\\form\\AbstractFormBuilderForm;\nuse wcf\\system\\form\\builder\\container\\FormContainer;\nuse wcf\\system\\form\\builder\\field\\TextFormField;\n\n/**\n * Shows the form to create a new person.\n *\n * @author  Matthias Schmidt\n * @copyright   2001-2021 WoltLab GmbH\n * @license GNU Lesser General Public License &lt;http://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php&gt;\n * @package WoltLabSuite\\Core\\Acp\\Form\n */\nclass PersonAddForm extends AbstractFormBuilderForm\n{\n    /**\n     * @inheritDoc\n     */\n    public $activeMenuItem = 'wcf.acp.menu.link.person.add';\n\n    /**\n     * @inheritDoc\n     */\n    public $formAction = 'create';\n\n    /**\n     * @inheritDoc\n     */\n    public $neededPermissions = ['admin.content.canManagePeople'];\n\n    /**\n     * @inheritDoc\n     */\n    public $objectActionClass = PersonAction::class;\n\n    /**\n     * @inheritDoc\n     */\n    public $objectEditLinkController = PersonEditForm::class;\n\n    /**\n     * @inheritDoc\n     */\n    protected function createForm()\n    {\n        parent::createForm();\n\n        $this-&gt;form-&gt;appendChild(\n            FormContainer::create('data')\n                -&gt;label('wcf.global.form.data')\n                -&gt;appendChildren([\n                    TextFormField::create('firstName')\n                        -&gt;label('wcf.person.firstName')\n                        -&gt;required()\n                        -&gt;autoFocus()\n                        -&gt;maximumLength(255),\n\n                    TextFormField::create('lastName')\n                        -&gt;label('wcf.person.lastName')\n                        -&gt;required()\n                        -&gt;maximumLength(255),\n                ])\n        );\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The properties here consist of three types: the \u201chousekeeping\u201d properties <code>$activeMenuItem</code> and <code>$neededPermissions</code>, which fulfill the same roles as for <code>PersonListPage</code>, and the <code>$objectEditLinkController</code> property, which is used to generate a link to edit the newly created person after submitting the form, and finally <code>$formAction</code> and <code>$objectActionClass</code> required by the PHP form builder API used to generate the form.</p> <p>Because of using form builder, we only have to set up the two form fields for entering the first and last name, respectively:</p> <ol> <li>Each field is a simple single-line text field, thus we use <code>TextFormField</code>.</li> <li>The parameter of the <code>create()</code> method expects the id of the field/name of the database object property, which is <code>firstName</code> and <code>lastName</code>, respectively, here.</li> <li>The language item of the label shown in the ouput above the input field is set via the <code>label()</code> method.</li> <li>As both fields have to be filled out, <code>required()</code> is called, and the maximum length is set via <code>maximumLength()</code>.</li> <li>Lastly, to make it easier to fill out the form more quickly, the first field is auto-focused by calling <code>autoFocus()</code>.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"tutorial/series/part_1/#personaddtpl","title":"<code>personAdd.tpl</code>","text":"acptemplates/personAdd.tpl <pre><code>{include file='header' pageTitle='wcf.acp.person.'|concat:$action}\n\n&lt;header class=\"contentHeader\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"contentHeaderTitle\"&gt;\n        &lt;h1 class=\"contentTitle\"&gt;{lang}wcf.acp.person.{$action}{/lang}&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;nav class=\"contentHeaderNavigation\"&gt;\n        &lt;ul&gt;\n            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"{link controller='PersonList'}{/link}\" class=\"button\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"icon icon16 fa-list\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Instead, usually a box is created in the sidebar on the right-hand side that contains <code>select</code> elements to determine sort field and sort order.</li> <li>The main part of the page is the listing of the people.   We use a structure similar to the one used for displaying registered users.   Here, for each person, we simply display a FontAwesome icon representing a person and show the person\u2019s full name relying on <code>Person::__toString()</code>.   Additionally, like in the user list, we provide the initially empty <code>ul.inlineList.commaSeparated</code> and <code>dl.plain.inlineDataList.small</code> elements that can be filled by plugins using the templates events. </li> </ul>"},{"location":"tutorial/series/part_1/#usergroupoptionxml","title":"<code>userGroupOption.xml</code>","text":"<p>We have already used the <code>admin.content.canManagePeople</code> permissions several times, now we need to install it using the userGroupOption package installation plugin:</p> userGroupOption.xml <pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;data xmlns=\"http://www.woltlab.com\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.woltlab.com http://www.woltlab.com/XSD/5.4/userGroupOption.xsd\"&gt;\n&lt;import&gt;\n&lt;options&gt;\n&lt;option name=\"admin.content.canManagePeople\"&gt;\n&lt;categoryname&gt;admin.content&lt;/categoryname&gt;\n&lt;optiontype&gt;boolean&lt;/optiontype&gt;\n&lt;defaultvalue&gt;0&lt;/defaultvalue&gt;\n&lt;admindefaultvalue&gt;1&lt;/admindefaultvalue&gt;\n&lt;usersonly&gt;1&lt;/usersonly&gt;\n&lt;/option&gt;\n&lt;/options&gt;\n&lt;/import&gt;\n&lt;/data&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>We use the existing <code>admin.content</code> user group option category for the permission as the people are \u201ccontent\u201d (similar the the ACP menu item).

As we want  administrators to link to specific people in menus, for example, we have to also implement the ILookupPageHandler interface by extending the AbstractLookupPageHandler class.</p> <p>For the <code>ILookupPageHandler</code> interface, we need to implement three methods:</p> <ol> <li><code>getLink($objectID)</code> returns the link to the person page with the given id.    In this case, we simply delegate this method call to the <code>Person</code> object returned by <code>PersonRuntimeCache::getObject()</code>.</li> <li><code>isValid($objectID)</code> returns <code>true</code> if the person with the given id exists, otherwise <code>false</code>.    Here, we use <code>PersonRuntimeCache::getObject()</code> again and check if the return value is <code>null</code>, which is the case for non-existing people.</li> <li><code>lookup($searchString)</code> is used when setting up an internal link and when searching for the linked person.    This method simply searches the first and last name of the people and returns an array with the person data.    While the <code>link</code>, the <code>objectID</code>, and the <code>title</code> element are self-explanatory, the <code>image</code> element can either contain an HTML <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag, which is displayed next to the search result (WoltLab Suite uses an image tag for users showing their avatar, for example), or a FontAwesome icon class (starting with <code>fa-</code>).</li> </ol> <p>Additionally, the class also implements IOnlineLocationPageHandler which is used to determine the online location of users. To ensure upwards-compatibility if the <code>IOnlineLocationPageHandler</code> interface changes, the TOnlineLocationPageHandler trait is used. The <code>IOnlineLocationPageHandler</code> interface requires two methods to be implemented:</p> <ol> <li><code>getOnlineLocation(Page $page, UserOnline $user)</code> returns the textual description of the online location.    The language item for the user online locations should use the pattern <code>wcf.page.onlineLocation.{page identifier}</code>.</li> <li><code>prepareOnlineLocation(Page $page, UserOnline $user)</code> is called for each user online before the <code>getOnlineLocation()</code> calls.    In this case, calling <code>prepareOnlineLocation()</code> first enables us to add all relevant person ids to the person runtime cache so that for all <code>getOnlineLocation()</code> calls combined, only one database query is necessary to fetch all person objects.</li> </ol> <p>This concludes the third part of our tutorial series after which each person has a dedicated page on which people can comment on the person.</p> <p>The complete source code of this part can be found on GitHub.</p>"},{"location":"tutorial/series/part_4/","title":"Part 4: Box and Box Conditions","text":"<p>In this part of our tutorial series, we add support for creating boxes listing people.</p>"},{"location":"tutorial/series/part_4/#package-functionality","title":"Package Functionality","text":"<p>In addition to the existing functions from part 3, the package will provide the following functionality after this part of the tutorial:</p> <ul> <li>Creating boxes dynamically listing people</li> <li>Filtering the people listed in boxes using conditions</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tutorial/series/part_4/#used-components","title":"Used Components","text":"<p>In addition to the components used in previous parts, we will use the <code>objectTypeDefinition</code> package installation plugin and use the box and condition APIs.</p> <p>To pre-install a specific person list box, we refer to the documentation of the <code>box</code> package installation plugin.</p>"},{"location":"tutorial/series/part_4/#package-structure","title":"Package Structure","text":"<p>The complete package will have the following file structure (excluding unchanged files from part 3):</p> <pre><code>\u251c\u2500\u2500 files\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 lib\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 system\n\u2502           \u251c\u2500\u2500 box\n\u2502           \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 PersonListBoxController.class.php\n\u2502           \u2514\u2500\u2500 condition\n\u2502               \u2514\u2500\u2500 person\n\u2502                   \u251c\u2500\u2500 PersonFirstNameTextPropertyCondition.class.php\n\u2502                   \u2514\u2500\u2500 PersonLastNameTextPropertyCondition.class.php\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 language\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 de.xml\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 en.xml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 objectType.xml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 objectTypeDefinition.xml\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 templates\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 boxPersonList.tpl\n</code></pre> <p>For all changes, please refer to the source code on GitHub.</p>"},{"location":"tutorial/series/part_4/#box-controller","title":"Box Controller","text":"<p>In addition to static boxes with fixed contents, administrators are able to create dynamic boxes with contents from the database.

You have to provide the supported sort fields via <code>$validSortFields</code> and specify the prefix used for the language items of the sort fields via <code>$sortFieldLanguageItemPrefix</code> so that for every <code>$validSortField</code> in <code>$validSortFields</code>, the language item <code>{$sortFieldLanguageItemPrefix}.{$validSortField}</code> must exist.</li> <li>The box system supports different positions.

One specific piece of code is the <code>$__boxPersonDescription</code> variable, which supports an optional description below the person's name relying on the optional language item <code>wcf.person.boxList.description.{$boxSortField}</code>.    We only add one such language item when sorting the people by comments:    In such a case, the number of comments will be shown.    (When sorting by first and last name, there are no additional useful information that could be shown here, though the plugin from part 2 adding support for birthdays might also show the birthday when sorting by first or last name.)</p> <p>Lastly, we also provide the language item <code>wcf.acp.box.boxController.com.woltlab.wcf.personList</code>, which is used in the list of available box controllers.</p>"},{"location":"tutorial/series/part_4/#conditions","title":"Conditions","text":"<p>The condition system can be used to generally filter a list of objects.

In both cases, it is checked if the current user has created the relevant piece of information to check the user-specific permissions or to fall back to the moderator-specific permissions.</p> <p>There also two getter methods for the person, the piece of information belongs to (<code>getPerson()</code>), and for the user profile of the user who created the information (<code>getUserProfile()</code>). In both cases, we use runtime caches, though in <code>getUserProfile()</code>, we also have to consider the case of the user who created the information being deleted, i.e. <code>userID</code> being <code>null</code>. For such a case, we also save the name of the user who created the information in <code>username</code>, so that we can return a guest user profile object in this case. The most interesting method is <code>getFormattedInformation()</code>, which returns the HTML code of the information text meant for output. To generate such an output, <code>HtmlOutputProcessor::process()</code> is used and here is where we first use the associated message object type <code>com.woltlab.wcf.people.information</code> mentioned before.</p> <p>While <code>PersonInformationEditor</code> is simply the default implementation and thus not explicitly shown here, <code>PersonInformationList::readObjects()</code> caches the relevant ids of the associated people and users who created the pieces of information using runtime caches:</p> files/lib/data/person/information/PersonInformationList.class.php

Additionally, we always list all pieces of information. If there are many pieces of information, a nicer solution would be a pagination or loading more pieces of information with JavaScript.</p> <p>First, we note the <code>jsObjectActionContainer</code> class in combination with the <code>data-object-action-class-name</code> attribute, which are needed for the delete button for each piece of information, as explained here. In <code>PersonInformationAction</code>, we have overridden the default implementations of <code>validateDelete()</code> and <code>delete()</code> which are called after clicking on a delete button. In <code>validateDelete()</code>, we call <code>PersonInformation::canDelete()</code> on all pieces of information to be deleted for proper permission validation, and in <code>delete()</code>, we update the <code>informationCount</code> values of the people the deleted pieces of information belong to (see below).</p> <p>The button to add a new piece of information, <code>#personInformationAddButton</code>, and the buttons to edit existing pieces of information, <code>.jsEditInformation</code>, are controlled with JavaScript code initialized at the very end of the template.</p> <p>Lastly, in <code>create()</code> we provide default values for the <code>time</code>, <code>userID</code>, <code>username</code>, and <code>ipAddress</code> for cases like here when creating a new piece of information, where do not explicitly provide this data. Additionally, we extract the information text from the <code>information_htmlInputProcessor</code> parameter provided by the associated WYSIWYG form field and update the number of pieces of information created for the relevant person.</p>"},{"location":"tutorial/series/part_5/#creating-and-editing-person-information","title":"Creating and Editing Person Information","text":"<p>To create new pieces of information or editing existing ones, we do not add new form controllers but instead use dialogs generated by the form builder API so that the user does not have to leave the person page.</p> <p>When clicking on the add button or on any of the edit buttons, a dialog opens with the relevant form:</p> ts/WoltLabSuite/Core/Controller/Person.ts <pre><code>/**\n * Provides the JavaScript code for the person page.\n *\n * @author  Matthias Schmidt\n * @copyright  2001-2021 WoltLab GmbH\n * @license  GNU Lesser General Public License &lt;http://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php&gt;\n * @module  WoltLabSuite/Core/Controller/Person\n */\n\nimport FormBuilderDialog from \"WoltLabSuite/Core/Form/Builder/Dialog\";\nimport * as Language from \"WoltLabSuite/Core/Language\";\nimport * as UiNotification from \"WoltLabSuite/Core/Ui/Notification\";\n\nlet addDialog: FormBuilderDialog;\nconst editDialogs = new Map&lt;string, FormBuilderDialog&gt;();\n\ninterface EditReturnValues {\nformattedInformation: string;\ninformationID: number;\n}\n\ninterface Options {\ncanAddInformation: true;\n}\n\n/**\n * Opens the edit dialog after clicking on the edit button for a piece of information.\n */\nfunction editInformation(event: Event): void {\nevent.preventDefault();\n\nconst currentTarget = event.currentTarget as HTMLElement;\nconst information = currentTarget.closest(\".jsObjectActionObject\") as HTMLElement;\nconst informationId = information.dataset.objectId!;\n\nif (!editDialogs.has(informationId)) {\neditDialogs.set(\ninformationId,\nnew FormBuilderDialog(\n`personInformationEditDialog${informationId}`,\n\"wcf\\\\data\\\\person\\\\information\\\\PersonInformationAction\",\n\"getEditDialog\",\n{\nactionParameters: {\ninformationID: informationId,\n},\ndialog: {\ntitle: Language.get(\"wcf.person.information.edit\"),\n},\nsubmitActionName: \"submitEditDialog\",\nsuccessCallback(returnValues: EditReturnValues) {\ndocument.getElementById(`personInformation${returnValues.informationID}`)!.innerHTML =\nreturnValues.formattedInformation;\n\nUiNotification.show(Language.get(\"wcf.person.information.edit.success\"));\n},\n},\n),\n);\n}\n\neditDialogs.get(informationId)!.open();\n}\n\n/**\n * Initializes the JavaScript code for the person page.\n */\nexport function init(personId: number, options: Options): void {\nif (options.canAddInformation) {\n// Initialize the dialog to add new information.\naddDialog = new FormBuilderDialog(\n\"personInformationAddDialog\",\n\"wcf\\\\data\\\\person\\\\information\\\\PersonInformationAction\",\n\"getAddDialog\",\n{\nactionParameters: {\npersonID: personId,\n},\ndialog: {\ntitle: Language.get(\"wcf.person.information.add\"),\n},\nsubmitActionName: \"submitAddDialog\",\nsuccessCallback() {\nUiNotification.show(Language.get(\"wcf.person.information.add.success\"), () =&gt; window.location.reload());\n},\n},\n);\n\ndocument.getElementById(\"personInformationAddButton\")!.addEventListener(\"click\", (event) =&gt; {\nevent.preventDefault();\n\naddDialog.open();\n});\n}\n\ndocument\n.querySelectorAll(\".jsEditInformation\")\n.forEach((el) =&gt; el.addEventListener(\"click\", (ev) =&gt; editInformation(ev)));\n}\n</code></pre> <p>We use the <code>WoltLabSuite/Core/Form/Builder/Dialog</code> module, which takes care of the internal handling with regard to these dialogs.

In addition to these two methods, the matching validation methods <code>validateGetAddDialog()</code> and <code>validateGetAddDialog()</code> are also added. As the forms for adding and editing pieces of information have the same structure, this form is created in <code>buildDialog()</code> using a <code>DialogFormDocument</code> object, which is intended for forms in dialogs. We fire an event in <code>buildDialog()</code> so that plugins are able to easily extend the dialog with additional data.</p> <p><code>validateGetAddDialog()</code> checks if the user has the permission to create new pieces of information and if a valid id for the person, the information will belong to, is given.  The method configured in the <code>WoltLabSuite/Core/Form/Builder/Dialog</code> object returning the dialog is expected to return two values: the id of the form (<code>formId</code>) and the contents of form shown in the dialog (<code>dialog</code>). This data is returned by <code>getAddDialog</code> using the dialog build previously by <code>buildDialog()</code>.</p> <p>After the form is submitted, <code>validateSubmitAddDialog()</code> has to do the same basic validation as <code>validateGetAddDialog()</code> so that <code>validateGetAddDialog()</code> is simply called. Additionally, the form data is read and validated. In <code>submitAddDialog()</code>, we first check if there have been any validation errors: If any error occured during validation, we return the same data as in <code>getAddDialog()</code> so that the dialog is shown again with the erroneous fields marked as such. Otherwise, if the validation succeeded, the form data is used to create the new piece of information. In addition to the form data, we manually add the id of the person to whom the information belongs to. Lastly, we could return some data that we could access in the JavaScript callback function after successfully submitting the dialog. As we will simply be reloading the page, no such data is returned. An alternative to reloading to the page would be dynamically inserting the new piece of information in the list so that we would have to return the rendered list item for the new piece of information.</p> <p>The process for getting and submitting the dialog to edit existing pieces of information is similar to the process for adding new pieces of information. Instead of the id of the person, however, we now pass the id of the edited piece of information and in <code>submitEditDialog()</code>, we update the edited information instead of creating a new one like in <code>submitAddDialog()</code>.
